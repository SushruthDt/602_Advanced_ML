# Concrete strength prediction


### Data Set Abstract :
Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash,water, uperplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate

### Data Dictionary
Feature Description and data types -
● Cement: a substance used for construction that hardens to other materials to bind them together, (measured in kg in a m3 mixture).
● Slag: Mixture of metal oxides and silicon dioxide, (measured in kg in a m3 mixture).
● Flyash: coal combustion product that is composed of the particulates that are driven out of coal-fired boilers together with the flue gases, (measured in kg in a m3 mixture).
● Water: It is used to form a thick paste, (measured in kg in a m3 mixture).
● SuperPlasticizer: used in making high-strength concrete, (measured in kg in a m3 mixture).
● CoaseSeaggregate: prices of rocks obtain from ground deposits, (measured in kg in a m3 mixture).
● Fineaggregate: the size of aggregate small than 4.75mm, (measured in kg in a m3 mixture).
● Age: Rate of gain of strength is faster to start with and the rate gets reduced with age,day (1~365).
● CsMPa: Measurement unit of concrete strength,Concrete compressive strength measured in MPa [OUTPUT VARIABLE] .
